# HTML- Code Refractoring
> We are trying to take currently existing code, apply semantic HTML elements. Additionally, there was certain criteria needed to meet acceptance located in the HW ReadMe
> Live demo [_here_] (https://allencheslik0.github.io/HTML-HW-1/).

## General Information
- The purpose of this project was to familiarize ourselves with:
	-Git Hub Reposotories
	-Terminal Command Line Entries
	-Semantic HTML elements
	-Basic HTML Trouble Shooting

## Technologies Used
- Git Hub
- VS Code - version 1.59.0
- Git Bash


## Setup
Setup was initially pretty complicated (for me) and required the following:
-Starter Code/ReadMe Instructions located on Git Lab Repo
-New Git Hub Repo
	-Read Me file
	-index.html
	-style.css
	-images
	-Git Clone, Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push
-Once everything was setup, work in VS Code to 'clean up' the existing code by swapping div tags for better suited tags
	-special note, after reading about aside class, we put one in line 50 as it made sense for the 'benefits' along the sidebar
	-added a footer in line 73
	-did a split of Section tags and Article tags as Article seemed to better align with the aside along the sidebar. Not a big deal and didnt change much visually, but made the code look cleaner to me
-Indentions for readability
-Ensure working links
	-Note that the one link not working initially didn't have an ID associated with. Once this was added, link worked
	-Updated Title from 'website' to 'Horiseon' in line 6



## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_. This was a homework assignment for general HTML understanding.


## Room for Improvement
I think we can further improve this by adding a Nav Bar instead of a Div in line 11. Doing this would probably require a change in the style properties as well

Room for improvement:
- Nav Bar Creation
- Menu?
